##  2) Stakings
Minimum staking is $100.

| Staking | Payment Method |
|--|--|
| Normal Staking | - 100% USDT Wallet |
| WIth Meets Staking  | - 90% USDT Wallet <br> - 10%mMeets(Excahnge From USDT rate) |

>  ***Note**:*

>  -  *Only members are allowed to perform real staking, which deducts USDT. Admins do not have permission to add real staking for member.  
>   -  *Only admins are allowed to perform free staking for member. Members cannot add free staking for themselves. 

  
##  3) Nodes
Each node costs $3000, and a member can only have one node, either a free one or a purchased one.
>  ***Note**:*

>  -  *When a member buys a node, they receive 3000 in free staking. Free nodes do not include the 3000 staking.
>   -  *Once a user has a purchased or free node, they become eligible to collect the Nodes Investment bonus, calculated on the first day of each month. For example, if a user buys a node on November 8th, they qualify for the bonus when calculated on December 1st, as only 23 days have passed (less than the 30-day limit). This allows them to receive the bonus for all of December. If 30 days have passed, eligibility for the bonus depends on achieving a minimum of $5000 in small zone sales.
